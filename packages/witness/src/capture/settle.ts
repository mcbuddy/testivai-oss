/**
 * Page-settled probe — "has this page stopped changing?" answered without
 * screenshotting repeatedly.
 *
 * WHY NOT NETWORK IDLE
 * --------------------
 * Playwright's own docs mark `networkidle` **DISCOURAGED**: "Don't use this
 * method for testing, rely on web assertions to assess readiness instead." It
 * is the wrong signal for a visual snapshot anyway — a page with analytics
 * beacons or long-polling never goes quiet yet is perfectly settled, while a
 * page can be network-idle with a CSS animation still running.
 *
 * WHY NOT A SETTLE LOOP
 * ---------------------
 * Playwright's built-in screenshots repeatedly until two consecutive images
 * match. That costs a capture per attempt. TestivAI already absorbs render
 * jitter through the DOM/style layer (identical DOM + identical styles reads as
 * noise, not a change), so the only gap left is content that had not *loaded*
 * yet — which is a load question, not a pixel question.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES
 * --------------
 * A cheap synchronous probe the adapter polls from the host language, exactly
 * like the existing fonts wait. It reports whether the document is complete,
 * whether images have finished, and how long the DOM has been quiet — the last
 * measured with a MutationObserver, which observes rather than monkey-patching
 * `fetch`/`XHR` and so cannot alter the behaviour of the page under test.
 *
 * SELF-CONTAINED on purpose: no imports, no closures, so it can be serialised
 * into the page and shipped to the Python, Java and Ruby adapters as a
 * generated asset — the same approach as the element-map collector.
