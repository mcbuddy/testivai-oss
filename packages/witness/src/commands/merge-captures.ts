/**
 * `testivai merge-captures <dirs...>`
 *
 * Unions captures produced by several sharded CI machines into this project's
 * `.testivai/temp/`, so a single `testivai report` can compare the whole suite
 * at once.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * A shard only runs a slice of the suite. Comparing inside a shard therefore
 * reports every baseline the *other* shards own as missing coverage — measured
 * on a real 8-shard run, every shard exited 3 with roughly 90% of the suite
 * listed as missing, and produced 8 partial reports with no combined view.
 *
 * The fix is not to merge eight reports; it is to not produce them. Shards
 * capture (the reporter does this automatically when Playwright reports a
 * sharded run), CI collects the capture directories, this command unions them,
 * and `testivai report` compares once against the full set.
 *
 * Accepts either shape, because `actions/download-artifact` produces the
 * first and a manual copy tends to produce the second:
 *
 *   collected/temp-shard-1/<snapshot>/screenshot.png   ← parent of artifacts
 *   collected/<snapshot>/screenshot.png                ← a temp dir itself
