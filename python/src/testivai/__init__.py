"""
TestivAI for Python — local-first visual regression capture for
playwright-python and Selenium, sharing baselines, reports, tolerances, and PR approvals
with the JS/TS adapters through one on-disk contract.

    from testivai import witness                    # playwright-python
    from testivai.selenium import witness as swit    # Selenium WebDriver

    def test_homepage(page):
        page.goto("http://localhost:3000")
        witness(page, "homepage")

Then `testivai report` (run automatically by the pytest plugin) compares
against `.testivai/baselines/` and writes `visual-report/index.html`.
