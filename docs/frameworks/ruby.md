# Ruby

Native adapter for **Capybara** and **Selenium** Ruby suites — no sidecar, no
Chrome debug port, no wrapper around your test command. You run
`bundle exec rspec` exactly as you do today.

New here? [vs. rolling your own](../vs-selenium-tooling.md) covers what this
replaces in a hand-rolled screenshot setup.

## Install

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "testivai", group: :test
```

```bash
bundle install
```

## Capture

```ruby
require "testivai"

RSpec.describe "Homepage", type: :feature do
  it "looks right" do
    visit "/"
    Testivai.witness(page, "homepage")
  end
end
```

`Testivai.witness` accepts a Capybara session (`page`), a Capybara driver, or a
bare `Selenium::WebDriver` — it unwraps to the underlying browser itself.

Cucumber is the same call from a step definition:

```ruby
Then("the page looks correct") do
  Testivai.witness(page, "checkout")
end
```

## Compare

```bash
bundle exec rspec     # your suite, unchanged — captures land in .testivai/temp/
npx testivai report   # diff against baselines + write the HTML report
```

The first run creates baselines under `.testivai/baselines/` — commit them.
Later runs diff against them and write `visual-report/index.html`.

:::note Why Node for the report?
Capture is native Ruby. The diff engine, tolerances, and HTML report are shared
by every adapter and live in `@testivai/witness` — one comparison
implementation rather than five subtly different ones. The Python and Java
adapters split the same way. If a project has no Node, run
`npx --yes @testivai/witness report`.
:::

## Options

```ruby
Testivai.witness(page, "checkout",
  ignore_selectors: [".live-chat", "#clock"],  # hidden from pixels AND the DOM signal
  stabilize: true,        # freeze animations, hide caret, await web fonts
  skip_dom: false,        # the DOM snapshot powers the noise hint
  skip_element_map: false,# the element map powers selector attribution
  max_elements: 3000,     # cap for very large pages
  project_root: nil)      # defaults to the nearest ancestor holding .testivai/
```

Anything omitted falls back to `.testivai/config.json`, the same file every
other adapter reads.

## What gets captured

| File | Powers |
|---|---|
| `screenshot.png` | The pixel diff and heatmap |
| `dom.html` | Noise hint, text-change detection |
| `elements.json` | Region→selector attribution, shift detection, style checks |

Full-page capture uses Chromium's CDP `captureBeyondViewport` when the driver
exposes `execute_cdp`, Firefox's native full-page screenshot when available, and
falls back to a viewport capture otherwise — documented, never silent.

The element-map collector is generated from a single TypeScript source shared by
every TestivAI adapter, so a Ruby lane and a Python lane produce identical maps
against the same baselines.

DOM and element-map capture are both best-effort: if a strict
Content-Security-Policy blocks the injected script, the screenshot still lands
and the report falls back to the layers it does have.

## Driver notes

Works with any Capybara driver that exposes `execute_script` — `selenium`
(Chrome, Firefox, Safari), Cuprite, Apparition. Rack-test has no browser and
cannot produce screenshots; use a real driver for visual specs:

```ruby
RSpec.describe "Homepage", type: :feature, js: true do
```
