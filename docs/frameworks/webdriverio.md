# WebdriverIO

The `@testivai/witness-webdriverio` adapter is a [WDIO service](https://webdriver.io/docs/customservices/) plus an explicit `testivai.witness(browser, name)` capture call. Same `.testivai/baselines/` layout as the Playwright adapter, same HTML report, same approval workflow.

This page covers **local mode** — no account, no API key, fully standalone. Cloud upload from WDIO is not yet supported (use the Playwright adapter for that path today).

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- WebdriverIO 8 or 9
- A working WDIO config (`wdio.conf.ts` or `wdio.conf.js`)

---

## 1. Install

```bash
npm install -D @testivai/witness @testivai/witness-webdriverio
```

`webdriverio` is a peer dependency — you should already have it from your existing setup.

---

## 2. Configure local mode

Create `.testivai/config.json` at your project root:

```json
{
  "mode": "local",
  "threshold": 0.1,
  "reportDir": "visual-report",
  "autoOpen": false,
  "maxDiffPercent": 0,
  "noiseAutoPass": false,
  "stabilize": true,
  "ignoreSelectors": []
}
```

This file is the local-mode marker. Without it, the adapter logs a warning and skips report generation — pixels are still captured, but no report is built.

---

## 3. Register the WDIO service

In your `wdio.conf.ts`:

```ts
import { TestivaiService } from '@testivai/witness-webdriverio/service';

export const config = {
  // ... your existing config
  services: [
    [TestivaiService, { quiet: false }],
  ],
};
```

The service runs `onComplete` after the test suite finishes. It compares everything in `.testivai/temp/` against `.testivai/baselines/` and writes the report to `visual-report/`.

---

## 4. Capture inside your tests

```ts
import { testivai } from '@testivai/witness-webdriverio';

describe('Homepage', () => {
  it('renders correctly', async () => {
    await browser.url('http://localhost:3000');
    await testivai.witness(browser, 'homepage');
  });

  it('product detail page', async () => {
    await browser.url('http://localhost:3000/products/widget');
    await testivai.witness(browser, 'product-widget');
  });
});
```

The capture function calls `browser.takeScreenshot()` (full-page screenshot via the WebDriver protocol) and `browser.execute(() => document.documentElement.outerHTML)` (page DOM for the noise-hint signal).

---

## 5. Run

```bash
npx wdio run wdio.conf.ts
```

- **First run**: baselines are written to `.testivai/baselines/<name>/`. Commit them: `git add .testivai/baselines`.
- **Later runs**: screenshots are diffed and a self-contained HTML report is written to `./visual-report/`.

---

## Approving changes

```bash
# Open the report
open visual-report/index.html

# Approve a single snapshot
npx testivai approve "homepage"

# Approve everything that changed
npx testivai approve --all

# Undo the last approval
npx testivai approve --undo "homepage"
```

Approved snapshots overwrite the baseline; the previous baseline is backed up to `.testivai/baselines/<name>/.previous/`.

---

## Pixel + DOM comparison

Each snapshot stores both the screenshot and the page DOM. When the report compares them:

- **Pixels match** → `passed`
- **Pixels differ, DOM matches** → `changed` with a "DOM unchanged — likely render noise" hint
- **Pixels differ, DOM differs** → `changed` with a count of added / removed / attribute changes

The same hint appears in PR comments via the TestivAI GitHub Action.

To skip DOM capture for a single snapshot (rare — useful only when DOM serialization is slow on a particular page):

```ts
await testivai.witness(browser, 'heavy-page', { skipDom: true });

// Hide dynamic elements for this snapshot only (merged with the global
// ignoreSelectors list from .testivai/config.json)
await testivai.witness(browser, 'dashboard', { ignoreSelectors: ['.live-feed'] });

// Opt out of capture stabilization (animations frozen, fonts awaited) per call
await testivai.witness(browser, 'animation-demo', { stabilize: false });

// Multi-capability runs: key baselines per capability so they don't collide
await testivai.witness(browser, 'homepage', { variant: 'firefox-mobile' });
```

---

## Service options

```ts
[TestivaiService, {
  projectRoot: process.cwd(),  // project root for .testivai/
  reportDir: 'visual-report',  // override report output dir
  threshold: 0.1,              // pixel diff threshold (0–1)
  autoOpen: false,             // open report after generation
  quiet: false,                // suppress logging
}]
```

All options are optional; defaults come from `.testivai/config.json`.

---

## Local-only by design

The WDIO adapter is local-only: captures, diffs, and the report are all produced on disk. If a legacy config sets `mode: "cloud"`, the adapter logs a clear warning and exits without generating a report.
