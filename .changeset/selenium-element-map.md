The Selenium (JavaScript) adapter now captures the element map, so region→selector attribution, the style-only-change verdict, and page-shift detection work there exactly as they do for Playwright. The page-side collector moved into `@testivai/witness` and is exported as `collectElementMap` / `buildElementMapExpression`, so every adapter injects the identical function rather than a copy. New per-call options: `skipElementMap` and `maxElements`. Capture is best-effort — if the script is blocked, the report falls back to the pixel and DOM layers instead of failing.
